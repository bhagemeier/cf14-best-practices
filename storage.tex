  \framesubtitle{What is storage?}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item In this context, "virtualized" storage
    \item Place to store your data in the cloud
    \item Two distinctive types of storage
      \begin{description}
        \item[block storage] \hfill\\
            local block devices connected to
            virtual machines, file system based
        \item[object storage] \hfill\\
            remote, network-accessible and file based
      \end{description}
    \item Different applications and underlying technologies

  \framesubtitle{Block storage}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Indistinguishable from ordinary physical drives
    \item Connected directly to a virtual machine; emulating \textit{IDE},
          \textit{SCSI} or \textit{SATA}
    \item Easier to integrate and use, no need to change the application
    \item Option to (dis)connect devices at runtime
    \item Ideal for short-term storage (input data \& results) or caching
    \item \textbf{NOT} intended for long-term storage or large
          amounts of data
  \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Storage}
  \framesubtitle{Object storage}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Remote storage accessible via a management protocol
          (\textit{CDMI}, \textit{S3}, \dots)
    \item File-oriented approach, each file available as
          an independent object
    \item Ideal for mid-term to long-term storage, large
          amounts of data
    \item Option to share data between users or groups
          (e.g. read-only public access)
    \item Direct use requires support in applications
  \end{itemize}
