There are various answers to this question
\begin{itemize}
\item Typically
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A blob of data representing the contents of a disk or file system
  \item Usually contains the root file system contents of an operating system
  \end{itemize}
\item Application data can be conveyed within images
\item Image is usually used as a term for a \emph{template} to create
  a virtual machine or \emph{instance} of it.
%% another wonderful diagram showing the relations among image and instance
