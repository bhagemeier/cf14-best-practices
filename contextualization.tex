  \framesubtitle{What is it?}

  A way to
  \begin{itemize}
    \item inject user credentials on boot
    \item perform simple configuration tasks
    \item customize generic images on boot
    \item pass arbitrary data into virtual machine instances
  \end{itemize}

  \hfill\\

  \textbf{NOT} a way to
  \begin{itemize}
    \item transfer large amounts of data
    \item perform complex or interactive tasks
    \item replace configuration management or orchestration tools
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Contextualization}
  \framesubtitle{How it works?}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Data is passed to the instance at boot
    \item The instance is expected to use it
    \item Implementation is usually platform-specific
    \item There are attempts to "standardize" the process
  \end{enumerate}

  \hfill\\

  \textbf{Delivery mechanisms}: custom-made scripts, direct injection, metadata services, contextualization disks
\end{frame}

  \framesubtitle{Using \textit{cloud-init}}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{De facto} standard for multi-platform contextualization
    \item Supports multiple delivery mechanisms $\rightarrow$ "datasources"
    \item Offers implementations of commonly performed tasks $\rightarrow$ "modules"
    \item Configuration in the form of a YAML file $\rightarrow$ "user\_data"
  \end{itemize}
